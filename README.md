# Web scraping, cloud storing and analysis

Webscraping and web application development


(1) Extracted top 100 movie's attributes from imdb (International Movies DataBase).

(2) Exported the web scraped data into excel file.

(3) Created the flask web application and imported the excel data into the application.

(4) Enabled View, Add, Edit and delete functions into web applications to work with the web scraped data.


Through this project, i have learned to scrape data from a selected website,  store the data in a web application and work across the functions detailed above.
The advantage of this project is, that it's work on a remote environment so that data can be accessed and the functions can be used at any given remote location.
